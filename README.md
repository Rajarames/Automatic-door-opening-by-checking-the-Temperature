# Automatic-door-opening-by-checking-the-Temperature
This Arduino code monitors temperature using an MLX90614 sensor and displays readings on an OLED. If the temperature exceeds 99째F, it shows "Danger," activates an LED, and moves a servo to 120째. Below 99째F, it displays the temperature, keeps the LED off, and sets the servo to 20째. An IR sensor detects presence, controlling another LED for alerts.
